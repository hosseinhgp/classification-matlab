classification method via matlab

KNN : KNN is a simple algorithm that stores. all available cases and classifies new cases based on a similarity measure.

Logisticregression : use Newton’s Method to implement logistic regression on a classification problem. we plot exam1 & exam 2 in one chart that understand the distribution of data. implement Newton’s Method in our program, starting with the initial value of θ =0. To determine how many iterations to use, calculate J (θ) for each iteration and plot our results.
